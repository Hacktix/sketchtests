`sketchtests` is a collection of self-written Gameboy Test ROMs, as a sort of spiritual successor to [my scribbltests](https://github.com/Hacktix/scribbltests), just a little more *clean* and advanced. As I currently only have two Gameboy models available to test on, any help with verifying tests passing/failing on other models is greatly appreciated. If so, please do send me a DM on Discord (Optixâ„¢#1337) or create a PR.

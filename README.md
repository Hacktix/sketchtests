### Introduction

`sketchtests` is a collection of self-written Gameboy Test ROMs, as a sort of spiritual successor to [my scribbltests](https://github.com/Hacktix/scribbltests), just a little more *clean* and *advanced*. 

### A Cry for Help

As I currently only have two Gameboy models available to test on, any help with verifying tests passing/failing on other models is greatly appreciated. If you're feeling generous and want to help me confirm that these tests pass/fail on other Gameboy models, please do send me a DM on Discord (Optixâ„¢#1337) or create a PR.

Also, I'm still relatively new to Gameboy development, so please do let me know if there are any improvements that can be made to the tests - although, keep in mind that the purpose of these tests is to use as little features as possible.

### Some fancy statistics

Because why not, honestly:

| Emulator           | Passed Tests |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| BGB                | 2/2 (100%)   |
| SameBoy            | 2/2 (100%)   |
| mGBA               | 2/2 (100%)   |
| Visual Boy Advance | 2/2 (100%)   |
